excerpt: "Exploring the reasons behind my love for writing and what keeps me coming back to the blank page."

Whenever someone asks me why I write, I pause. The answer isn’t simple or singular. It’s a tapestry woven from curiosity, longing, joy, and occasionally pain.

I write to understand. Putting thoughts into sentences forces me to slow down and listen to the world — and to myself. In the act of writing, hidden patterns reveal themselves and a fleeting feeling can be captured before it slips away.

I write to connect. Storytelling bridges gaps between strangers, turning the private into something communal. When I share a piece of my story, I invite others to see their own experiences reflected back at them.

I write to remember. Memories are fragile. Words fix them in place, like pressing a flower into a book. Years from now, I hope to look back at these entries and feel the emotions of this moment as if no time has passed.

Ultimately, I write because not writing feels impossible. The blank page is both a challenge and a refuge, an invitation to explore the unknown and a homecoming all at once.
